Project Overview: Brick Breaker Game in Java

The Brick Breaker game in Java is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a paddle to bounce a ball and break a wall of bricks. The objective is to clear all the bricks using the ball without letting it fall below the paddle. This project is an excellent introduction to game development and Java programming, offering a hands-on experience with graphics, user input, and game logic.

Key Features to Add:

1. Graphics and GUI: Implement a visual interface with colorful bricks, a paddle, and a bouncing ball using Java's graphics libraries.
2. Game Logic: Develop core mechanics for paddle movement, ball bouncing, and brick destruction. Include collision detection and a scoring system.
3. Levels and Difficulty: Design multiple levels with increasing complexity and adjust difficulty by altering ball speed and introducing challenges.
4. User Input: Enable keyboard input for paddle control, and add features like pausing and restarting.
5. Sound Effects and Music: Enhance the gaming experience with sound effects for ball hits, brick breaks, and background music.
6. Game Over and Victory Conditions: Implement conditions for game over and define victory conditions for completing levels.
7. Optimizations: Optimize code for better performance, considering features like double buffering.
8. Documentation: Provide clear documentation and comments for the codebase to aid understanding.
